This course is an introduction to data mining. Topic includes  Design and implementation 
of data warehouse and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems; data mining concepts, 
methods, systems, implementations, and applications. 
This folder includes all programming assignments of this course.

- Assignment 1(Apriori algorithm) and 2(SPADE algorithm) focused on [Associate-Rule Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning). 

The first Two assignments are about pattern mining by using apriori algorithm and spade algorithm. 
The Third assignment is about building decision tree and k-nearest neighbor.
The Forth assignment is about basic clustering algorithm: agglomerative clustering and kmeans.
