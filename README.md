This repositary contains materials from two course, intro to data mining (UIUC CS412) and data mining (Umich EECS476).

Four programming assignments (CS412) are included here as follows.
- Assignment 1(Apriori algorithm) and 2(SPADE algorithm) focused on Associate-Rule Learning. 
- Assignment 3 is Classifcation algorithm: Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor.
- Assignment 4 is Clustering algorithm: Agglomerative Clustering and Kmeans.

Two additional assignments from (EECS476) are about implementing map reduce based Apriori Algorithm, Associate Rule mining, and Kmeans in JAVA. \
The reason to code in Map Reduce format is to make the algorithms working on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
