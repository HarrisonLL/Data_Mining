This repositary contains materials from two course, intro to data mining (UIUC CS412) and data mining (Umich EECS476).

Four programming assignments (CS412) are included here as follows.
- Assignment 1(Apriori algorithm) and 2(SPADE algorithm) focused on Associate-Rule Learning. 
- Assignment 3 is Classifcation algorithm: Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor.
- Assignment 4 is Clustering algorithm: Agglomerative Clustering and Kmeans.

One additional assignment (EECS476) is about implementing Hadoop and Apriori Algorithm in JAVA. \
The reason to write Apriori in Map Reduce is to make the algorithm working on large datasets.
